# reply-link
A Wikipedia user script to make replying to comments easier.

## Running tests

Install the dependencies you need for the tests:

```
npm install
```

Run the tests:

```
npm test
```

You can pass Mocha arguments after a --. For example, since `-b` is the Mocha
argument to bail after the first failed test, this next command runs the
reply-link tests and bails after the first failed one:

```
npm test -- -b
```
