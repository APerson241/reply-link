In a recent AE case, I wanted to reply to a comment made by Sandstein in the section "Result concerning Atsme". Instead, the script [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&diff=813830612&oldid=813826151 added the reply] to Masem's comment above. I have no idea why...
